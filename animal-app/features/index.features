Feature: Index the database
    As a user
    So I can have a high-level overview of the database.
    I want to see all the entries in my database
    
Scenario: Index Entries
    Given the following exists
        | Exhibit       | Common Name   |
        | 32            | Black Bear    |
    Given I am on the Oak Creek home page
    Then I should see "Oak Creek Animal Manager"
    And I should see "32"
    And I should see "Black Bear"
